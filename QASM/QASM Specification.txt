QASM Specification
------------------

QASM instructions are as follows. Lines begining with '#' are comments. All other lines should be of the form op args where op-args pairs are:

qubit 	name,initval
cbit 	name,initval
measure	qubit
H 		qubit
X 		qubit
Y 		qubit
Z 		qubit
S 		qubit
T 		qubit
nop 	qubit
zero 	qubit
discard	qubit
slash 	qubit
dmeter	qubit
cnot 	ctrl,target
c-z 	ctrl,target
c-x 	ctrl,target
toffoli	ctrl1,ctrl2,target
ZZ 		b1,b2
SS		b1,b2
swap	b1,b2
Utwo	b1,b2
space	qubit
def		opname,nctrl,texsym
defbox	opname,nbits,nctrl,texsym


Where:
def 	- define a custom controlled single-qubit operation, with
			opname = name of gate operation
			nctrl = number of control qubits
			texsym = latex symbol for the target qubit operation
defbox 	- define a custom muti-qubit-controlled multi-qubit operation, with
			opname = name of gate operation
			nbits = number of qubits it acts upon
			nctrl = number of control qubits
			texsym = latex symbol for the target qubit operation
qubit 	- define a qubit with a certain name (all qubits must be defined)
			name = name of the qubit, eg q0 or j2 etc
			initval = initial value (optional), eg 0
cbit 	- define a cbit with a certain name (all cbits must be defined)
			name = name of the cbit, eg c0
			initval = initial value (optional), eg 0
H 		- single qubit operator ("hadamard")
X 		- single qubit operator
Y 		- single qubit operator
Z 		- single qubit operator
S 		- single qubit operator
T 		- single qubit operator
nop 	- single qubit operator, just a wire
space 	- single qubit operator, just an empty space
dmeter 	- measure qubit, showing "D" style meter instead of rectangular box
zero 	- replaces qubit with |0> state
discard	- discard qubit (put "|" vertical bar on qubit wire)
slash 	- put slash on qubit wire
measure - measurement of qubit, gives classical bit (double-wire) output
cnot 	- two-qubit CNOT
c-z 	- two-qubit controlled-Z gate
c-x 	- two-qubit controlled-X gate
swap 	- two-qubit swap operation
Utwo 	- two-qubit operation U
ZZ 		- two-qubit controlled-Z gate, symmetric notation; two filled circles
SS 		- two-qubit gate, symmetric; open squares
toffoli	- three-qubit Toffoli gate
